      <h3>Basic Info</h3>
      <p>Sparrows are a family of small passerine birds.  They are primarily seed-eaters, though they also consume small insects. Some species scavenge for food around cities and, like gulls or rock doves will happily eat virtually anything in small quantities.</p>
      <h3>Behaviour and Ecology</h3>
      <p>Sparrows are generally social birds, with many species breeding in loose colonies and most species occurring in flocks during the non-breeding season. The sparrows are some of the few passerine birds that engage in dust bathing. Sparrows will first scratch a hole in the ground with their feet, then lie in it and fling dirt or sand over their bodies with flicks of their wings. </p>

        <h3>Relationship with humans</h3>
        <p>Sparrows may be the most familiar of all wild birds worldwide. Many sparrow species commonly live in agricultural areas, and for several, human settlements are a primary habitat. The Eurasian tree and house sparrows are particularly specialised in living around humans and inhabit cities in large numbers.</p>
